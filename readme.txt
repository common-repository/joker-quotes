Displays randomly selected Joker quotes from the film The Dark Knight.

== Description ==

This plugin for Wordpress adds the Joker Quotes widget, which displays randomly selected Joker quotes from the film The Dark Knight.

Each quote is wrapped in a blockquote tag and is cited as being from "The Joker".

This widget and its author are in no way associated with DC Comics, Warner Bros., or anyone else that claims a financial stake in the Batman franchise, and I'm not looking to challenge any of their claims to copyright or profit financially in any way from this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `joker-quote.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Drop the widget in your sidebar or place `<?php joker_quote(); ?>` in your template

== Version History ==

1.5.0: 2009-02-15: Many of the quotes in the first release were rather long, making it occasionally unwieldy in a sidebar widget. Shortened these monologue-length quotes by spreading them out over several entries. Looks much nicer now.

1.0.0: 2008-12-21: First release.
